                <p>Vital Mediquip, formerly known as Vitol Agencies Limited, was established in 2014. It began as a small
                    company with limited capital, dedicated to fulfilling the laboratory and medical diagnostic needs of the
                    East Africa region.

                <p>
                    In its early stages, the company had a staff of three individuals: one served as a technical sales
                    representative, and two provided essential office support. Over time, Vitol Agencies has experienced
                    steady and impressive growth, successfully gaining a significant market presence.
